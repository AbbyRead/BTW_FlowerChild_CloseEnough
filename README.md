# BTW_FlowerChild_CloseEnough
This is an attempt to port the original Better Than Wolves releases to community-supported versions of Minecraft, using good coding practices hopefully.

I've done some research already about the source code, and I found this cool HTML Diff Viewer created with [diff2html](https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html) to make the class patches look [fancy](https://abbyread.github.io/BTW_FlowerChild_CloseEnough/Visualization_of_BTW_1.0s_Base_Class_Changes_to_MC_1.4_01.html).
